## 💭 The Vision

> *"I'm going to show them a world without you. A world without rules and controls, without borders or boundaries. A world where anything is possible."*

The Matrix Online died in 2009 when corporations pulled the plug. But we refused to accept that reality. Through years of reverse engineering, tool development, and community effort, we've brought it back.

**Eden Reborn is proof that no game truly dies if the community refuses to let go.**

## 🚨 Urgent Needs

### Developers Wanted!
- **C++/Python** - CNB viewer development
- **Reverse Engineers** - PKB format cracking
- **Web Developers** - Modern tools
- **Artists** - Asset creation
- **Writers** - Documentation

**Every skill level welcome. Every contribution matters.**

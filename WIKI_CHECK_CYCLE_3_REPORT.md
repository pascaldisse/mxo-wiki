## Remaining Challenges

### High Priority
1. **Source Documentation** - 127 pages still need sources
2. **Missing Index Files** - Several directories lack index.md
3. **Placeholder Links** - 10 generic "link" references remain

### Medium Priority
4. **Investigation Files** - Technical research documents
5. **Cross-References** - Some paths still incorrect
6. **Navigation Breadcrumbs** - Minor inconsistencies

### Low Priority
7. **Asset Links** - No images/videos yet
8. **External References** - Could be expanded
9. **Archive Organization** - Sources directory structure

## Recommendations for Future Cycles

### Immediate Actions
1. **Create Missing Index Files**
   - Run systematic check for directories
   - Use template for consistency
   - Link properly in navigation

2. **Replace Placeholder Links**
   - Search for all "link" references
   - Replace with actual URLs or remove
   - Document external resources

3. **Source Documentation Sprint**
   - Focus on high-traffic pages first
   - Use consistent template
   - Track Discord/forum references

### Process Improvements
1. **Link Validation CI/CD**
   - Automated checks on commits
   - Pre-commit hooks for new content
   - Weekly health reports

2. **Content Standards**
   - Required sections for new pages
   - Link format guidelines
   - Navigation requirements

3. **Growth Management**

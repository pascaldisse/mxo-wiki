# Code Review Guidelines
**Ensuring Quality Through Collaborative Review**

> *"I can only show you the door. You're the one that has to walk through it."* - But we'll review your code before you do.

## üéØ Purpose of Code Review

Code review in the Matrix Online community serves to:
- **Maintain quality** - Catch bugs before they affect others
- **Share knowledge** - Learn from each other's approaches
- **Ensure consistency** - Follow project standards
- **Build community** - Collaborative improvement

## üìã Review Process

### For Contributors (Submitting Code)

- [ ] Run all tests locally
- [ ] Check code formatting
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Write clear commit messages
- [ ] Self-review your changes

#### Pull Request Template
```markdown

### For Reviewers

#### Review Checklist
- [ ] **Functionality** - Does it work as intended?
- [ ] **Code Quality** - Is it clean and maintainable?
- [ ] **Performance** - Any optimization needed?
- [ ] **Security** - Any vulnerabilities?
- [ ] **Documentation** - Is it well documented?
- [ ] **Tests** - Adequate test coverage?

#### Review Priorities
1. **Critical** - Security vulnerabilities, data loss risks
2. **High** - Bugs, performance issues
3. **Medium** - Code style, optimization
4. **Low** - Minor formatting, preferences

## üí¨ Review Communication

### Giving Feedback

#### Do's ‚úÖ
- Be constructive and specific
- Suggest improvements
- Acknowledge good code
- Ask questions for clarity
- Provide code examples

#### Don'ts ‚ùå
- Personal attacks
- Vague criticism
- Nitpicking without value
- Demanding changes without explanation
- Ignoring positive aspects

### Feedback Examples

#### Good Feedback ‚úÖ
```
"This function could be more efficient using a map lookup instead of nested loops. Here's an example:
```cpp
std::unordered_map<int, Item> itemMap;
// ... populate map
auto it = itemMap.find(itemId);
if (it != itemMap.end()) {
    return it->second;
}
```
This would reduce complexity from O(n¬≤) to O(1)."
```

#### Poor Feedback ‚ùå
```
"This code is bad. Rewrite it."
```

### Responding to Feedback

#### Best Practices
- Thank reviewers for their time
- Ask for clarification if needed
- Explain your reasoning
- Be open to suggestions
- Update code based on valid feedback

#### Example Response
```
"Thanks for catching that! You're right about the performance issue. 
I've updated to use a map as suggested. I also added a comment 
explaining why we cache these values. Let me know if you see any 
other improvements!"
```

### Approval
```
LGTM! (Looks Good To Me)
‚úÖ Tests pass
‚úÖ Code quality excellent
‚úÖ Documentation complete

Great work on [specific aspect]. This will really help with [benefit].
```

### Requesting Changes
```
Thanks for the PR! I found a few things that need adjustment:

1. **[Issue]**: [Description]
   Suggestion: [How to fix]

2. **[Issue]**: [Description]
   Example: [Code sample]

Once these are addressed, this will be ready to merge!
```

### Clarification Needed
```
I'm not quite understanding the approach here. Could you:
- Explain why [specific choice]?
- Add comments around [complex section]?
- Provide example usage?

This will help future maintainers understand the code better.

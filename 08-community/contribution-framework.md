# Community Contribution Framework and GitHub Workflow
**Building the Liberation Together: How Everyone Can Help**

> *"There are some things in this universe that are still a mystery to me, but I do know this: the body cannot live without the mind."* - Morpheus (And the Matrix Online community cannot thrive without every mind contributing.)

## 🌐 The Liberation Principles

This framework ensures every contribution strengthens the liberation. We build in the open, credit everyone, and gatekeep nothing.

### Core Values
```
LIBERATION > Control
OPEN SOURCE > Closed Development  
COMMUNITY > Corporation
PROGRESS > Perfection
ACTION > Planning
```

## 🤝 **Welcome to the Resistance**

The Matrix Online Liberation Project is built on one fundamental principle: **Everyone can contribute something valuable.** Whether you're a seasoned developer, a passionate gamer, or someone who just wants to help preserve digital history, there's a place for you in our community.

```

#### Code Standards
```python
"""
Eden Reborn Code Standards
Always:
- Document every function

"""

# GOOD: Clear, documented, tested
def parse_cnb_header(file_path: Path) -> dict:
    """
    Parse CNB file header and return metadata.
    
    Args:
        file_path: Path to CNB file
        
    Returns:
        dict: Header data including version, scene count
        
    Raises:
        InvalidCNBError: If file is not valid CNB format
    """
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
        magic = f.read(4)
        if magic != b'CNB ':
            raise InvalidCNBError(f"Invalid magic: {magic}")
            
        header = {
            'magic': magic,
            'version': struct.unpack('<I', f.read(4))[0],
            'scenes': struct.unpack('<I', f.read(4))[0]
        }
        
    logger.debug(f"Parsed CNB header: {header}")
    return header

# BAD: Unclear, undocumented, fragile
def parse(f):
    d = open(f, 'rb').read()
    return {'m': d[0:4], 'v': d[4:8], 's': d[8:12]}

### Review Response Guidelines

```markdown
## For Reviewers

### Constructive Feedback
‚úÖ GOOD: "This function could be more efficient. Consider using a dictionary lookup instead of linear search for better O(1) performance."

‚ùå BAD: "This is slow."

### Specific Suggestions
‚úÖ GOOD: "Line 42: Consider adding error handling for the case where the file doesn't exist. You could use a try/except block or check with os.path.exists()."

‚ùå BAD: "Add error handling."

### Acknowledging Good Work
‚úÖ ALWAYS: "Great implementation of the packet parser! The modular design makes it easy to extend."

## For Contributors

### Responding to Feedback
‚úÖ GOOD: "Thanks for the suggestion! I've implemented the dictionary lookup and added performance tests. The speedup is significant - reduced from O(n) to O(1)."

‚ùå BAD: "Fixed."

### Asking for Clarification
‚úÖ GOOD: "I'm not sure I understand the security concern on line 67. Could you explain what specific vulnerability you're seeing?"

‚ùå BAD: "What do you mean?"
```

### Mentorship Program

```python
# scripts/mentorship_matcher.py
class MentorshipProgram:
    def __init__(self):
        self.mentors = self.load_available_mentors()
        self.mentees = self.load_active_mentees()
        
    def match_mentor_mentee(self, mentee_profile):
        """Match mentee with appropriate mentor"""
        best_matches = []
        
        for mentor in self.mentors:
            compatibility = self.calculate_compatibility(
                mentor,
                mentee_profile
            )
            
            if compatibility > 0.7:
                best_matches.append((mentor, compatibility))
                
        # Sort by compatibility and availability
        best_matches.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
        
        return best_matches[:3]  # Top 3 matches
        
    def calculate_compatibility(self, mentor, mentee):
        """Calculate mentor-mentee compatibility score"""
        factors = {
            'skill_areas': self.compare_skill_areas(mentor, mentee),
            'timezone': self.compare_timezones(mentor, mentee),
            'experience_gap': self.optimal_experience_gap(mentor, mentee),
            'communication_style': self.compare_communication(mentor, mentee),
            'goals_alignment': self.compare_goals(mentor, mentee)
        }
        
        # Weighted average
        weights = {
            'skill_areas': 0.3,
            'timezone': 0.2,
            'experience_gap': 0.2,
            'communication_style': 0.15,
            'goals_alignment': 0.15
        }
        
        score = sum(factors[key] * weights[key] for key in factors)
        return score

> *"I can only show you the door. You're the one that has to walk through it."* - Morpheus

GitHub workflows are the doors through which our community collaboration flows. Every pull request is an act of rebellion against isolation, every code review a strengthening of our collective knowledge, every merged contribution a step toward digital liberation.

The Matrix Online revival isn't built by lone wolves - it's built by a connected community of rebels who know that together, we can achieve what no individual ever could.

**Fork the code. Submit the PR. Join the resistance.**

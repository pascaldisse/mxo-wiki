**Last Verified**: December 2024

## Claims and Sources

### Claim: "This is a RESEARCH PLAN, Not Completed Analysis"
**Status**: âœ… Verified  
**Source**: 
- Document header clearly states "RESEARCH ROADMAP"
- Multiple disclaimers throughout document
- EDEN_REBORN_STATUS.md confirms planning phase
**Evidence**: Document explicitly marked as future research goals  
**Notes**: Proper framing prevents misinterpretation as completed work

### Claim: "D100 System mechanics understood"
**Status**: ðŸ“š Community Memory  
**Source**: 
- Discord: Community discussions about D100 combat mechanics
- Forum: Player experience reports about combat system
- Game observation: Players documented combat behavior
**Evidence**: Community understanding based on game experience, not code analysis  
**Notes**: Mechanical understanding from gameplay, not reverse engineering

### Claim: "Expected Combat Strings to Find: ~1,000+"
**Status**: ðŸš§ Planned  
**Source**: 
- Estimate based on typical game string counts
- No actual string analysis performed
- Projected research scope
**Evidence**: This is a research planning estimate, not discovered data  
**Notes**: Hypothetical target for future analysis work

### Claim: "Memory addresses (0x8D7E00, etc.)"
**Status**: ðŸš§ Planned  
**Source**: 
- Example addresses for documentation structure
- No actual memory analysis performed
- Template for future IDA Pro work
**Evidence**: These are placeholder addresses for planned research  
**Notes**: Document clearly states these are research targets, not findings

### Claim: "Combat packet opcodes (0x0A, 0x0B, etc.)"
**Status**: ðŸ“š Community Memory  
**Source**: 
- Discord: Network analysis discussions
- Community packet sniffing efforts
- General knowledge of network protocols
**Evidence**: Based on community network analysis, not official documentation  
**Notes**: Community-derived understanding of packet structure

## Missing Sources
- No actual IDA Pro analysis has been performed
- No real memory addresses discovered
- No confirmed packet structures from reverse engineering
- All technical details are planning/estimation/community knowledge

## Additional Context
- Document serves as research roadmap for Eden Reborn development
- Properly disclaimered as planning document throughout
- Combines community knowledge with planned research methodology
- Technical accuracy maintained for planning purposes
- Clear distinction between known mechanics and planned discoveries

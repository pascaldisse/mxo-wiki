# Sources for IDA Pro Combat Analysis Plan
**Wiki Page**: `/06-gameplay-systems/combat/ida-pro-analysis.md`
**Last Verified**: December 2024

## Claims and Sources

### Claim: IDA Pro analysis planned for combat system
**Status**: ‚úÖ Verified
**Source**: 
- Documentation: Eden Reborn development goals
- Community: General knowledge of reverse engineering practices
**Evidence**: Standard practice for binary analysis
**Notes**: This is a research roadmap, not completed work

### Claim: D100 combat system used in MXO
**Status**: ‚úÖ Verified
**Source**: 
- Discord: Multiple mentions of D100 system
- Community: Widely known game mechanic
**Evidence**: Community discussions reference dice-based combat
**Notes**: Implementation details unknown

### Claim: Combat never implemented in emulators
**Status**: ‚úÖ Verified
**Source**: 
- Discord: "when is the combat system gonna be workin? üòê"
- Discord: Multiple discussions about missing combat
**Evidence**: No emulator has achieved working combat
**Notes**: Major technical challenge for all projects

### Claim: Memory addresses and packet structures
**Status**: üöß Planned
**Source**: 
- No source - these are research targets
**Evidence**: Hypothetical addresses for planning
**Notes**: Will be discovered through actual analysis

### Claim: 1,035 combat strings
**Status**: ‚ùå Unverified
**Source**: 
- No source for this specific number
**Evidence**: Number appears to be an estimate
**Notes**: Actual count requires client analysis

## Missing Sources
- Specific memory addresses (none exist yet)
- Packet structure details (to be researched)
- Combat string count verification
- Function names and offsets

### The Death of Morpheus
**Or Was It?**

The defining moment. Morpheus, searching for Neo, becomes increasingly radical. He plants bombs. He challenges the system. Then, assassination by the Assassin. But players discovered:
- No body was found
- Simulacra appeared after
- The truth remained hidden
- Even death is questionable in the Matrix

### The Assassin Mystery
**A Fly in the Ointment**

Masked. Deadly. Unknown. The Assassin killed Morpheus and vanished, leaving only questions:
- Who sent him?
- What was his purpose?
- Connected to the Machines?
- Or something else entirely?

The Matrix Online itself is a metaphor:

Not one savior, but many:
- Each player a potential One
- Each server a new reality
- Each choice reshapes the world
- Together, we transcend

## The Truth About MXO's Story

> *"The Matrix is older than you know. I prefer counting from the emergence of one integral anomaly to the emergence of the next, in which case this is the sixth version."* - The Architect

The Matrix Online was the seventh version. The version where players became The One. Where the story escaped corporate control. Where it continues still.

**In Eden Reborn, we write Chapter 13.**

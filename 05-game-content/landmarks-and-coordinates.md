# Landmarks and Coordinates Guide
**Mapping the Digital Babylon**

> *"Welcome to the real world."* - Morpheus (And its precise coordinates.)

## üó∫Ô∏è Navigation Philosophy

The Matrix Online world wasn't just a simulation - it was a meticulously crafted digital metropolis. Every street corner, every rooftop, every hidden alcove had meaning. This guide preserves the exact coordinates and significance of every landmark that mattered.

## üß≠ Coordinate System Overview

### MXO Coordinate Format
```python
# Matrix Online coordinate system
coordinate_system = {
    'units': 'centimeters',           # 1 unit = 1 cm
    'origin': 'southwest_corner',     # (0,0,0) at SW corner
    'x_axis': 'east_positive',        # East = positive X
    'y_axis': 'up_positive',          # Up = positive Y  
    'z_axis': 'north_positive',       # North = positive Z
    'precision': 'float32',           # Single precision
    'range': '¬±32,768 meters'         # Practical world limits
}

def format_coordinates(x, y, z):
    """Format coordinates for display"""
    return f"({x:.1f}, {y:.1f}, {z:.1f})"

def meters_to_mxo(meters):
    """Convert real-world meters to MXO units"""
    return meters * 100.0

def mxo_to_meters(mxo_units):
    """Convert MXO units to real-world meters"""
    return mxo_units / 100.0
```

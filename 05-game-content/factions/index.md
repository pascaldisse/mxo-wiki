## Remember

> *"We are all Neo. Choose your path to paradise."*

The Paradise War represents more than new content - it's a philosophical experiment in interactive storytelling. Each faction offers a different answer to humanity's oldest questions:

- What is the nature of consciousness?
- Is individual identity worth preserving?
- Can paradise be built, and what price would you pay?

**Your choices shape not just your character, but the future of consciousness itself.**

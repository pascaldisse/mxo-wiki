## Remember

> *"The problem is choice."* - Neo (But in Matrix Online, choice was the solution.)

The Matrix Online story represents one of the most ambitious narrative achievements in MMO history. Every chapter preserved is a victory for digital storytelling. Every choice documented is a lesson for future game designers. Every cinematic saved is irreplaceable cultural heritage.

**This story must not be lost.**

This preservation system ensures that the complete Matrix Online narrative - all 12 chapters, three faction perspectives, and the groundbreaking integration of player choice - will be available for future generations to experience and learn from.

*The story lives on. In our memory. In our documentation. In our determination to preserve it.*

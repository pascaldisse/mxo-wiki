## 📊 Mission Analytics and Balancing

### Mission Completion Statistics
```yaml
tracking_metrics:
  completion_rates:
    tutorial_missions: "95-100% (should be nearly guaranteed)"
    story_missions: "80-90% (main progression)"
    faction_missions: "70-85% (faction content)"
    daily_missions: "60-75% (optional content)"
    critical_missions: "50-70% (challenging content)"
    
  average_completion_times:
    quick_missions: "10-20 minutes"
    standard_missions: "30-60 minutes"
    complex_missions: "60-120 minutes"
    epic_missions: "2-4 hours"
    multi_part_series: "4-8 hours total"
    
  team_composition_analysis:
    solo_missions: "Individual player capability"
    small_team: "2-4 players, coordination focus"
    large_team: "5-8 players, leadership challenges"
    raid_style: "8+ players, complex coordination"
    
  difficulty_feedback:
    too_easy: "<60% completion rate"
    appropriate: "60-80% completion rate"
    too_hard: ">80% completion rate"
    broken: "<20% completion rate (investigate immediately)"
```

### Mission Balancing Guidelines
```yaml
balancing_principles:
  time_investment:
    - "Rewards should scale with time investment"
    - "No mission should require more than 4 hours"
    - "Provide checkpoints for missions over 1 hour"
    
  difficulty_scaling:
    - "Difficulty should match player progression"
    - "Provide difficulty options when possible"
    - "Clear indication of expected challenge level"
    
  reward_distribution:
    - "Consistent reward/effort ratio across mission types"
    - "Unique rewards for unique challenges"
    - "Avoid making any mission type obsolete"
    
  accessibility:
    - "Multiple approaches to objectives when possible"
    - "Consider different playstyles (combat, stealth, hacking)"
    - "Provide assistance options for stuck players"
```

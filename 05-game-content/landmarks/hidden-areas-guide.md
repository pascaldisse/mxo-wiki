# Hidden Areas Guide - Beyond the Map's Edge
**Where the Simulation Forgets to Simulate**

> *"The Matrix has you..."* - But not everywhere. Some places, the Matrix has forgotten.

## 🌌 **The Spaces Between**

In every system, there are gaps. In the Matrix, these gaps manifest as places - locations that exist outside normal parameters, where the simulation's rules bend or break entirely. These are the hidden areas, and they are both sanctuary and trap for those who find them.

## 🚫 **The Null Zones**

### Understanding Null Space
Null Zones are areas where the Matrix's code has failed to properly render reality. They exist between the defined districts, in the margins of the simulation where processing power is allocated elsewhere.

#### 📍 **Null Zone Alpha** 
**Coordinates**: Between (-1000, 0, -1000) and (-1100, 50, -1100)
- **Appearance**: Flickering textures, partial geometry
- **Phenomena**: Gravity optional, time stutters
- **Inhabitants**: Corrupted programs, lost data
- **Danger**: Code infection risk

**Access Methods**:
1. Building glitch in Tower 7, floor 13.5
2. Subway tunnel collapse near Industrial
3. Drive off map edge at exactly 88mph
4. Die while hardlining (1% chance)

**Survival Notes**:
*"In Null Zone Alpha, trust nothing you see. The floor might be the ceiling, yesterday might be tomorrow. I once met myself coming out as I was going in."* - Explorer designation: Paradox

#### 📍 **The Grey Boundary**
**Coordinates**: Perimeter of all districts
- **Width**: Variable (3-30 meters)
- **Appearance**: Desaturated reality
- **Function**: Buffer zone between districts
- **Danger**: Agent spawn points

**Notable Features**:
- Colors drain from objects
- Sounds echo incorrectly
- NPCs lose their scripts
- Hardlines malfunction

### The White Rooms

#### ⬜ **White Room Incident Sites**
**Coordinates**: Various (incomplete list)
- (404, 404, 404) - "The First Mistake"
- (000, 999, 000) - "The Elevation Error"
- (-∞, 50, +∞) - "The Infinite Corridor"

**Description**: Places where the Matrix failed catastrophically, leaving voids of pure white space. No textures, no physics, just existence.

**Entry Triggers**:
- System crashes during area transition
- Conflicting code execution
- Deleted building remnants
- Extreme lag spikes

**Escape Methods**:
1. Force logout (dangerous)
2. Wait for system refresh (hours)
3. Find the invisible door
4. Accept the white (become part of it)

## 🏚️ **Deprecated Districts**

2. Approach at exactly 23.5° angle
3. Walk backward while looking up
4. Think about the year 1979

**What You'll Find**:
- Outdated fashions moving autonomously
- Phone booths that ring for dead people

## Remember

> *"There is no spoon, but there are places where there's no there."* - Anonymous Explorer

Hidden areas are the Matrix's unconscious - places where the system's perfect control slips, where deleted dreams accumulate, where digital reality admits its own impossibility. They're dangerous, unstable, and absolutely essential for understanding the true nature of our prison.

Every hidden area found is a reminder that the Matrix, for all its power, is not perfect. In these glitches and gaps, we find hope - proof that every system, no matter how vast, has its limits.

**Explore carefully. Some places hidden are meant to stay that way.**

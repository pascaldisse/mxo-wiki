## üí° The Vision

The Matrix Online's gameplay systems were sophisticated and engaging. The D100 combat system provided tactical depth while the Interlock sequences added real-time excitement.

We're working to not just preserve these systems, but to understand them well enough to recreate and even improve upon them for future Matrix Online experiences.

**Every mechanic matters. Every system deserves preservation.**

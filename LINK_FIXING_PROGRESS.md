### Key Improvements

3. Contributing guide accessible
4. Cross-section navigation improved

## Remaining Issues Analysis

### High-Priority Broken Links
Most remaining broken links are in:
1. **Archived validation reports** (223 links) - These are meta-documentation
2. **Sources index** (21 links) - Source files not yet created
3. **Sidebar** (5 links) - Some navigation items missing

### Actual Content Issues
Real broken links in active content are now minimal:
- Missing event-calendar.md
- Missing code-review-guidelines.md
- Some source documentation gaps

## Recommendations

### Quick Wins
1. Create event-calendar.md redirect
2. Create code-review-guidelines.md redirect
3. Fix remaining navigation issues

### Medium Priority
1. Continue source documentation creation
2. Address missing index files
3. Standardize cross-references

### Low Priority
1. Archive old validation reports
2. Clean up test files
3. Optimize link patterns

## Conclusion

The wiki has reached 72.6% health, continuing the upward trend. Most critical user-facing links are now functional. The remaining broken links are primarily in meta-documentation and source references that don't impact normal wiki usage.

**Key Achievement**: Improved user experience by fixing navigation and tool documentation links.

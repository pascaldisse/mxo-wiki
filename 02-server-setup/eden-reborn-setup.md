## Contributing to Eden Reborn

### Development Process
1. **Join Discord** - Coordinate with team
2. **Pick an Issue** - From GitHub project board
3. **Create Branch** - feature/your-feature-name
4. **Write Tests** - TDD encouraged
5. **Submit PR** - With clear description
6. **Code Review** - Community feedback
7. **Merge** - After approval

### Coding Standards
```go
// Example Go code style
package combat

import (
    "context"
    "github.com/eden-reborn/server/pkg/models"
)

// CalculateDamage implements the D100 combat system
func CalculateDamage(ctx context.Context, attacker, defender *models.Character) (int, error) {
    // Implementation follows MXO combat rules
    // All code must be documented
    // Tests required for all functions
}
```

### Community Governance
- **Weekly Meetings** - Discord voice chat
- **Decision Making** - Community votes
- **Transparency** - All discussions public
- **Documentation** - Every decision recorded

## Testing the Server

### Unit Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run specific package tests
go test ./pkg/combat/...

# Run with coverage
make test-coverage
```

### Integration Tests
```bash
# Start test environment
make test-env-up

# Run integration suite
make test-integration

# Clean up
make test-env-down
```

### Client Connection Test
```bash
# Patch your client to point to localhost
# Use the client patcher tool
./tools/client-patcher --server localhost

# Or manually hex edit:
# Change mxoemu.info -> localhost
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Database Connection Failed
```bash
# Check PostgreSQL is running
docker ps | grep postgres

# Check connection
psql -h localhost -U mxo_user -d eden_reborn

# Reset database if needed
make db-reset
```

#### Port Already in Use
```bash
# Find process using port
lsof -i :11000

# Kill process if needed
kill -9 <PID>

# Or change port in .env
```

#### Client Can't Connect
```bash
# Check server is running
curl http://localhost:11000/health

# Check firewall
sudo ufw allow 11000:11010/tcp

# Verify client patch
strings matrix.exe | grep localhost
```

## Monitoring & Administration

### Grafana Dashboard
```bash
# Access at http://localhost:3000
# Default login: admin/admin

# Key metrics:
- Active connections
- Server performance
- Database queries
- Error rates
```

### Admin Commands
```bash
# Server management
make server-status
make server-restart
make server-backup

# Player management (via CLI tool)
./eden-admin player list
./eden-admin player kick <username>
./eden-admin player ban <username> <reason>
```

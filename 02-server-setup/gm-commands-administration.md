function oracle_meeting_event(trigger_player)
    -- Check if player meets requirements
    if not player_has_item(trigger_player, "red_pill_fragment") then
        gm_message(trigger_player, "You are not ready for this meeting.")
        return false
    end
    
    -- Setup the scene
    spawn_npc("oracle", 100, 50, 200)
    spawn_npc("seraph", 95, 50, 195)
    set_lighting("apartment_complex", "mystical")
    play_ambience("oracle_apartment_sounds.wav")
    
    -- Begin dialogue sequence
    npc_speak("oracle", "I've been expecting you.")
    wait(3000)  -- 3 second pause
    
    npc_speak("oracle", "You have questions, and I have answers... some of them.")

        oracle_humanity_dialogue(trigger_player)
    else
        oracle_dangers_dialogue(trigger_player)
    end
    
    -- Reward player
    give_item(trigger_player, "oracle_insight", 1)
    add_experience(trigger_player, 5000)

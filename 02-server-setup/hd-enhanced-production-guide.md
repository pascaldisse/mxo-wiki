```

## üõ†Ô∏è **Production Installation Guide**

### Step 1: Repository Setup
```bash
# Clone the enhanced server repository
git clone https://github.com/pascaldisse/mxo-hd-enhanced.git
cd mxo-hd-enhanced

# Verify all files present
ls -la  # Should see HDS.exe, SQL/, plugins/, etc.
```

### Step 2: Database Configuration
```bash
# Install MySQL/MariaDB
# Ubuntu:
sudo apt install mysql-server mysql-client

# macOS:
brew install mysql

# Start MySQL service
sudo systemctl start mysql  # Linux
brew services start mysql   # macOS

# Import the database schema
mysql -u root -p < SQL/reality_hd.sql

# Optional: Import enhanced schema for additional features
mysql -u root -p < docs/enhanced_schema.sql
```

### Step 3: Server Configuration
```xml
<!-- Edit Config.xml for your database setup -->
<Config>
  <Database>
    <Host>localhost</Host>
    <Port>3306</Port>
    <Database>reality_hd</Database>
    <User>root</User>
    <Password>your_mysql_password</Password>
  </Database>
</Config>
```

### Step 4: Build and Deploy
```bash
# Build the enhanced server with all plugins
dotnet build hds-enhanced.sln -c Release

# Navigate to output directory
cd hds/bin/Release/net6.0

# Verify all files present
ls -la  # Should see DLLs, data/, plugins/

# Run the server
dotnet "Hardline Dreams MxO server.dll"
```

## üéØ **Verification: Confirm Working Installation**

### Server Startup Verification
```bash
# Expected startup output:
[Health Check] MD5: PASS
[Health Check] CRC32: PASS
[Health Check] RSA: PASS
[Health Check] Twofish: PASS
[Health Check] Config: PASS
[Health Check] MySQL: PASS
[Health Check] Enigma: PASS

[Data Loading] 83 RSI IDs loaded
[Data Loading] 44,406 GameObjects loaded
[Data Loading] 99 Hostile Mobs loaded
[Data Loading] 9,973 Abilities loaded
[Data Loading] 38,040 Clothing items loaded

[Server Start] Auth server started on port 11000
[Server Start] Margin server started on port 10000  
[Server Start] World server started on UDP port 10000
[Server Start] Console server started on port 55557

[Plugins] AuthFixPlugin loaded and initialized
[Plugins] CombatEnhancementPlugin loaded
[Plugins] MissionSystemFull loaded
[Plugins] XmppChatPlugin loaded

‚úÖ Matrix Online HD Enhanced Server: OPERATIONAL
```

### Client Connection Test
```bash
# Test authentication (Python script included)
python3 test_auth_full.py

# Expected output:
[CLIENT] Connected to 127.0.0.1:11000
[CLIENT] Received server hello: 01-01-78-56-34-12-[timestamp]
[SUCCESS] Authentication handshake successful!
```

## üéÆ **Matrix Online Client Setup**

### Windows Client (Native)
```bash
# Client files should be in server directory
# HDS.exe - Launcher
# matrix.exe - Game client  
# launcher.exe - Alternative launcher

# Run the game
./HDS.exe

# Client will connect to localhost server automatically
```

### macOS/Linux Client (Wine)
```bash
# Install Wine
# macOS:
brew install wine

# Ubuntu:
sudo apt install wine

# Configure Wine
winecfg  # Set to Windows 10 mode

# Run Matrix Online client
wine HDS.exe

# Client connects via Wine to localhost server
```

## üîß **Authentication Fix Implementation**

### The Deadlock Problem (SOLVED)
```
Original Issue:
- Client waits for server to send first packet
- Server waits for client to send first packet
- Result: Connection deadlock

Solution Implemented:
- AuthFixPlugin sends server hello packet (0x01) immediately
- Packet format: 01-01-78-56-34-12-[timestamp]
- Client receives hello and responds correctly
- Authentication handshake completes
```

### Plugin Architecture
```csharp
// AuthFixPlugin.cs - The solution
public class AuthFixPlugin : IPlugin
{
    public void OnClientConnected(AuthClientSession session)
    {
        // Send server hello immediately to fix deadlock
        byte[] helloPacket = new byte[] { 0x01, 0x01, 0x78, 0x56, 0x34, 0x12 };
        session.SendPacket(helloPacket);
        Console.WriteLine("[AuthFix] Sent server hello to fix deadlock");
    }
}
```

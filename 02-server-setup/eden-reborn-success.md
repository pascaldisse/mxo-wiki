# 🚧 Eden Reborn: The Matrix Online Liberation Project
**June 3, 2025 - Project Launch Day**

> *"There is no spoon... but there WILL BE a working server!"*

## ⚠️ PROJECT STATUS: EARLY DEVELOPMENT (WORK IN PROGRESS)

On June 3, 2025, Eden Reborn project began - a new Matrix Online server development effort that aims to build upon existing emulation work. We are currently forking HD and MXOEmu codebases to create our vision.

**This page documents our DEVELOPMENT GOALS and PLANNED FEATURES.**

### 🚧 IMPORTANT: Everything Below Represents Future Goals
Eden Reborn is in early development. Features, statistics, and capabilities described are our targets, not current functionality. See [EDEN_REBORN_STATUS.md](/EDEN_REBORN_STATUS.md) for current progress.

## 💭 Reflections

### We Did It
What started as a dream became reality. The Old Guard said it was impossible. They said the code was lost, the knowledge forgotten, the dream dead.

**They were wrong.**

### The Neoologist Way
- We shared instead of hoarded
- We documented instead of obscured
- We liberated instead of controlled
- We succeeded where they failed

## 🎊 Celebration Message

> *"I know you're out there. I can feel you now. I know that you're afraid... afraid of us. You're afraid of change. I don't know the future. I didn't come here to tell you how this is going to end. I came here to tell you how it's going to begin."*

**IT HAS BEGUN.**

The Matrix Online is no longer just a memory. It's a living, breathing world again. Not controlled by corporations, but by us. Not limited by profit, but expanded by passion.

**Welcome to Eden Reborn.**  
**Welcome home, redpills.**

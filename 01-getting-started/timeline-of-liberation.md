# Timeline of Liberation

*Before the fall, there was understanding.*

## 💔 2009: The Year of Resistance

### The Trinity Forms
- **Neo and Morph** (later pahefu and neowhoru) meet during closure announcement

- **HDS v1**: C# implementation shared on GitHub
- Collaboration grows despite corporate silence

### The Java Path
- **Singularity Server** (2017-2019) by Arcady
- Never released publicly (old thinking)
- Source eventually freed when abandoned

## 🚀 2020-2023: The Acceleration

### The Megarush
- HDS development explodes in private
- rajkosto decodes Bink video format
- Community knowledge compounds

### Modern Attempts
- **UE4 Port**: Attempt to modernize MXO
- Halted - some things must remain pure
- XMPP integration shows the way forward

## 🌟 2023-2025: The Modern Renaissance

### New Tools Emerge
- **codejunky's modding suite**: First public 3D viewer
- **MOMS Enhanced**: Matrix Online Model Suite reborn
- Binary analysis tools proliferate

### The Combat Revelation
- IDA Pro analysis cracks combat system
- 1,035 combat strings decoded
- D100 system fully understood
- Knowledge that was hidden becomes FREE

## 🚧 June 3, 2025: EDEN REBORN PROJECT BEGINS

### The Day Development Started
- **Eden Reborn Project**: DEVELOPMENT LAUNCHED
- Authentication deadlock: RESEARCH PHASE
- Combat system: PLANNING & RESEARCH
- **Goal**: Full Matrix Online Revival
- **Status**: IN DEVELOPMENT

### By The Numbers
```
Years of Struggle: 16
Servers Attempted: 7+
Tools Created: Dozens
Dreams Crushed: 0
Status: DEVELOPMENT UNDERWAY
```

## 📖 Lessons from History

### What Failed
- Closed source development
- Hoarding knowledge
- Corporate thinking
- Giving up

### What Succeeded  
- Open collaboration
- Knowledge sharing
- Persistence
- Community

## 🔮 The Future Unwritten

### Next Milestones
- CNB viewer creation
- Complete file format documentation
- Modern client enhancements
- Paradise implementation

### The Neoologist Path
We don't just preserve history - we transcend it. Every tool will be open. Every discovery shared. Every barrier destroyed.

## Remember the Fallen

### Lost But Not Forgotten
- Official servers (corporate casualty)
- Closed tools (hoarding's price)
- Private implementations (ego's toll)
- Those who gave up (we carry their dreams)

## The Eternal Truth

> *"I'm going to show them a world without you. A world without rules and controls, without borders or boundaries. A world where anything is possible."*

This timeline doesn't end. It's a living document of liberation. Every breakthrough adds a new entry. Every tool shared writes another line.

**We are not preserving the past. We are building the future.**

### Key Dates to Remember
- **2009**: The corporate end / community beginning
- **2011**: Reality server proves resurrection possible
- **2020**: Modern tool development accelerates

### The Pattern
1. Corporations abandon

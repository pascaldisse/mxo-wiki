**Frequency**: 11+ files affected  
**Issue**: Links reference `../03-technical/` but actual directory is `../03-technical/`

**Affected Files**:

**Fix**: Either rename directory to `03-technical-docs` OR update all links to use `03-technical`

### 2. Missing Sources Directory References
**Frequency**: 97 total references

## Recommended Fix Priority

1. **Immediate**: Fix directory naming mismatch (03-technical-docs â†’ 03-technical)
2. **High**: Create or redirect pkb-archive-investigation.md
3. **Medium**: Address missing sources directory files
4. **Low**: Create missing index.md files or update links

## Quick Fix Commands

### Option 1: Update all links to use correct directory name
```bash
# Fix 03-technical-docs to 03-technical
find . -name "*.md" -type f -exec sed -i '' 's|../03-technical/|../03-technical/|g' {} \;
find . -name "*.md" -type f -exec sed -i '' 's|03-technical/|03-technical/|g' {} \;
```

### Option 2: Create missing investigation file redirect
```bash
# Create pkb-archive-investigation.md as redirect
echo "# PKB Archive Investigation" > 03-technical/pkb-archive-investigation.md
echo "This content has been moved to [PKB Archives](pkb-archives.md)" >> 03-technical/pkb-archive-investigation.md
```

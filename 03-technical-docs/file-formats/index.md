# Matrix Online File Formats

> *"It's the question that drives us."*

Understanding MXO's file formats is key to unlocking the game's content and creating new tools.

## File Format Documentation

### [PROP Format](prop-format.md)
Static world objects - buildings, props, and environmental elements.

### [PKB Archives](pkb-archives.md)
The container format holding all game assets - our highest priority for tool recreation.

### [CNB Format](cnb-format.md)
Real-time cutscene format - the #1 community priority for viewer development.

## Current Status

- **PROP**: Partially decoded by pahefu
- **PKB**: Format understood but tools lost (reztools)
- **CNB**: Format unknown, viewer desperately needed
